Project # 1
prod_data will have duplicate POs and missing deal IDs
deal_data will not
We will want to merge on PO and associate the deal ID with each PO.
"master_key" will be PO number
"foregin_key" will be Deal ID
We will want to create an index after we merge data -maybe?
We will want to rename columns
There are three different ways total units purchased quantities are named between the folders:
    prod_data:
        Total_SKU_on_PO
        mfp_quantity
    deal_data
        quantity

Important_Variables we should consider
    quantity
    revenue
    deal_type
    business_type
    cost
    vendor_id
    automation_tools
    lead_source
    sku or chassis
